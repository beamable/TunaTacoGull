# Tuna Taco Gull

A sample "rocks paper scissors" game with Beamable Microservices. 
The rules are simple, 
1. Tuna beats Taco
2. Taco beats Gull
3. Gull beats Tuna
4. There are no ties; if both players select the same option, the first player to do so wins.
5. Your "hint" is non-commital and only exists to try and confuse your opponent.
